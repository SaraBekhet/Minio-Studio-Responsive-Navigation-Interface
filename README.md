# Minio-Studio-Responsive-Navigation-Interface
Minio Studio is a sleek, responsive navigation system built with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JS. As the developer, I used Flexbox and Media Queries to solve layout challenges, creating a sticky header and a custom mobile menu. The result is a lightweight, cross-browser compatible interface that prioritizes speed and modern UI/UX standards.
